# AI Engineer 30D — Svitlana

This repository documents my 30-day AI Engineer learning sprint (1–2h/day).
Main goal: build a solid AI Engineering foundation and ship a small production-style project.

## Goals (30 days)
- Build strong ML basics: train/val/test, leakage prevention, metrics
- Train baseline ML models (scikit-learn)
- Train a small neural network (PyTorch)
- Build a simple RAG pipeline (LLM + retrieval)
- Ship a small API demo + evaluation + basic tracking

## Success criteria (measurable)
By Day 30 I can:
- Create a clean ML project structure and reproduce experiments
- Build a baseline model with proper split and metrics
- Explain and avoid data leakage (with a checklist)
- Do error analysis and propose improvements based on evidence
- Deliver a working demo (notebook + small service) with documentation

## Repo structure
- `notebooks/` — experiments and templates
- `src/` — scripts (training, eval, utils) later
- `reports/` — short weekly notes and results
- `data/` — datasets (if small) or links/instructions
- `learning_log.md` — daily learning log

## How I work (daily)
- 5–10 min: recall (what I remember from yesterday)
- 20–30 min: learn (notes <= 10 lines)
- 30–70 min: build (code / experiment)
- 5–10 min: ship (commit + learning_log update)

## Current status
- Day 0: Kaggle setup + first notebook shipped
- Day 1: create ML notebook template + update README
